<p>I found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks. Nothing. Nelson Mandela said, “There is no passion to be found, playing small and settling for a life that’s less than the one you’re capable of living.”</p>

<p>Matthew McConaughey has always been an actor that I have respected and looked up to over the years. He is a very unique individual with an incredibly unique view of the world we live in today. As Joe Rogan said, he has some form of whiskey sipping philosophy that captivates your attention and always leaves you with a one-liner you will never forget. He gave a commencement speech at the University of Houston where his father played college football and he revealed 13 truths that he has learned throughout his life that he thought would be a benefit for the graduating class of 2015.</p>

<p>If I win, I will be happy. If I don’t, I won’t. It’s an if, then cause and effect,
quid pro quo standard that we cannot sustain, because we immediately raise it
every time we attain it. See, happiness demands a certain outcome.
It is result reliant. And I say if happiness is what you’re after,
then you’re going to be let down frequently and you’re going to be
unhappy much of your time.</p>
