        <p>Matthew McConaughey has always been an actor that I have respected and looked up to over the years. He is a very unique individual with an incredibly unique view of the world we live in today. As Joe Rogan said, he has some form of whiskey sipping philosophy that captivates your attention and always leaves you with a one-liner you will never forget. He gave a commencement speech at the University of Houston where his father played college football and he revealed 13 truths that he has learned throughout his life that he thought would be a benefit for the graduating class of 2015.</p>
<p>Number 1 &ldquo;Life is not easy&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 2 &ldquo;The word Unbelievable is the stupidest word in the dictionary&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 3 &ldquo;Happiness&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 4 &ldquo;Define Success for yourself&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 5 &ldquo;Process of Elimination is the first step to our identity&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 6 &ldquo;Dont Leave Crumbs&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 7 &ldquo;Dissect your successes, and practice the art of gratitude&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 8 &ldquo;Make Voluntary Obligations&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 9 &ldquo;From Can to Want&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 10 &ldquo;A roof is a man made thing&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 11 &ldquo;Turn the Page&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 12 &ldquo;Give your Obstacles Credit&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 13 &ldquo;How to Know When We Cross the Truth&rdquo;</p>
